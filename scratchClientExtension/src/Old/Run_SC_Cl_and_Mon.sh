#	 configfile:  config file for scratchClient
#	 showRPipage: optional. Y or N (default). Whether or not to show the page 
#		      that contains the link how to make the scratchClient extension
#		      blocks visible in Scratch 2.
#
# This script starts scratchClient and a browser to show the scratchClient
# monitor. It will use the config file passed as parameter
#
# It will monitor whether scratchClient gets really started within 4 seconds
# and if not, start it again.
# When it runs it will start the browser to look at the monitor page.
