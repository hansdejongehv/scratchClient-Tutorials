# This is the install script which will install the material of the 
# scratchClient-Tutorials project on the Raspberry Pi where this script is run.
#
# It will:
# - download and install the Arduino IDE, which is needed for
#   loading the scratchClient sketch in the Arduino Nano or Uno.
#   This is only done if it is not installed already.
# - put scratchClient at the right place. There is an option given to 
#   install a release that was tested with or the most recent version
#   from the internet site for scratchClient.
# - download and install the packages that scratchClient needs.
# - put the material of the PiAndMore workshop in a subfolder in the 
#   home directory and give the scripts execute permission.
# - Put sample files on the desktop
# - Put links to the tutorials on the desktop
