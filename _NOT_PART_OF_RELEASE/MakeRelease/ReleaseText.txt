#the archive was unpacked.

# To install a complete image
In some cases, some packages that scratchClient is dependent on go to a next release which is not completely compatible.
If this is the case, please file an issue, but if you want to evaluate the software, you can download the complete image instead.

The file contains the Raspian OS released on 2018-03-13, plus everything needed to run scratchClient.

After download, 
* decompress the image using 7-zip. If you do not have the software, then you can download it for free from: https://www.7-zip.org/	
* When you have the decompressed image, you can put it on an SD card of at least 8 Gbyte using e.g.
	* Win32DiskImager, downloadable from https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
	* DiskImager, downloadble from https://github.com/RomanBelkov/DiskImager/wiki
	(The DiskImager is btw a great program to load an image to multiple SD cards at the same time.)

If you run into problems that the image does not fit, you can best take a 16 Gbyte SD card. The image was created with an 8 Gbyte SD card. However not all cards sold as 8Gbyte have the exact same amount of sectors. If you copy it to a 16 Gbyte card it will fit for sure.
